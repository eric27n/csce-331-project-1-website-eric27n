                <p class="resume-text">I have been invested in computer science since I was in high school, where I took the AP Computer Science A exam in 2019. At Texas A&M University, I have been immersed in a variety of computer science skill sets and languages, though I find that I am most interested in data science and machine learning. I am most proficient in C++ and Python, but I also have moderate to basic understandings of Java, R, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Scheme, and SQL. In addition, I also have experience with Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn; Git; Microsoft Office; and Unix.</p>
